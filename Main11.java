    Each BankAccount11 object represents one user's account
    information including name and balance of money.

    Add a field to the BankAccount11 class named transactionFee for a real number representing an amount of money to
    deduct every time the user withdraws money. The default value is $0.00, but the client can change the value. Deduct
    the transaction fee money during every withdraw call (but not from deposits). Make sure that the balance cannot go
    negative during a withdrawal. If the withdrawal (amount plus transaction fee) would cause it to become negative,
    donâ€™t modify the balance at all.
